[![Build](https://github.com/jxcodetw/python-hello-world-package/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jxcodetw/python-hello-world-package/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This absurdly simple hello world package exists only to learn and play with all the new Python tooling thatâ€™s hard to keep up with. I'm pretty sure it's going to be out-dated again very soon :P.
