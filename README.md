# python-hello-world-package
[![Build](https://github.com/jxcodetw/python-hello-world-package/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jxcodetw/python-hello-world-package/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This absurdly simple hello world package exists only to learn and play with all the new Python tooling thatâ€™s hard to keep up with. I'm pretty sure it's going to be out-dated again very soon :P.

# Development
```shell
uv sync --extra dev # Install dependencies and the package in editable mode

uv run pytest # Run all unit tests
uv run pytest --cov=hello_world # Report coverage in terminal
uv run pytest --cov=hello_world --cov-report=html # generate htmlcov

# Lint src and tests
uv run ruff check src tests 

# Type check the 'src' directory (try 'tests' too and see what explodes)
uv run mypy src # Maybe ruff will save us from MyPy someday

# Show formatting differences without applying them
uv run ruff format --diff
# Automatically format code
uv run ruff format
```

# Build the Wheel Package
```shell
uv build
```
